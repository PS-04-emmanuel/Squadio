# SQUADIO

Squadio is a language-learning social platform designed to help users learn new languages through real, meaningful conversations with native speakers. Instead of relying only on textbooks or automated lessons, Squadio connects people directly so they can practice naturally, improve fluency, and understand cultural nuances.

The app allows users to create an account and sign in securely. Once logged in, users can search for and connect with native speakers of the language they wish to learn. Squadio includes a chat system and video calling feature built using Stream, a SaaS-based communication service that ensures smooth real-time interactions.

In chats, users can see who is currently online, view timestamps, and check read/unread message status for clear conversation tracking. Squadio also features a notification panel for managing friend requests, which can be accepted or rejected. Additionally, a suggestion list helps users discover new people to connect with based on their language interests.

Through these features, Squadio creates a supportive environment for authentic language practice and helps users learn by speaking directly with the people who know the language best—its native speakers.
